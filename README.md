Main function located in Application.cpp, to edit and rebuild open in visual studio 2022.
To run as is, just open "NonEuclidRenderer.exe" in the folder "NonEuclidRenderer".

If rebuilt, and want to use the built exe (which would be placed in '\x64\Debug'), the exe must be moved to '\NonEuclidRenderer' or it wont be able to find the 'res' folder for shaders and textures.
